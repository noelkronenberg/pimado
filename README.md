# To-Do List

## Goal

A minimalist to-do list application that is accessible via the browser and has markdown export. *This goal is currently still in active development and has not yet been achieved.*

## Process

1. Direct your terminal to the downloaded folder 
2. Run *pipenv shell*
3. Run *pipenv install django==2.1*

4. Run *pip(3) install markdownify*
5. Run *pip install django-markdownify*

5. Run *python manage.py runserver*
6. Open development server URL (+ /todo/) in your browser (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:8000/todo/)
